What is this project about?

This project is to illustrate how to assemble an analysis on GitHub in a way that improves the odds that someone else will be able to reproduce the results.

Typically for a real project, I would insert a discussion of my understanding of the project right here.

This is just to say hello to you, Theresa!! How's it going?

This is Keith saying hello!
